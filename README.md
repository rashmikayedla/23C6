This repository contains a web-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This interactive version allows users to play the game in their browser.

 **Overview**
 
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods (A, B, and C) and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in decreasing size on the first rod (A), the smallest disk being at the top, thus forming a conical shape.

The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the source rod (A) to the destination rod (C), using the auxiliary rod (B) as a temporary holding place.  There are a few simple rules that must be followed:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. Disks can only be moved between the rods.
